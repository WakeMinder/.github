## 🚀 Overview

**WakeMinder** is a productivity app for macOS that ensures you never forget what you were just about to do. It syncs reminders from your iPhone or Apple Watch and delivers them instantly the moment your Mac wakes from sleep or wakes up. No more forgetting tasks because you walked away from your device; WakeMinder puts what matters front-and-center exactly when you sit back at your Mac.

Many reminder apps rely on time-based alerts or notification banners that can easily get lost among dozens of other notifications. WakeMinder changes that: your reminders appear *immediately upon waking your Mac*, making sure your priorities are visible before you dive into other tasks. Whether it's a quick note you dictated to your Watch, a link you shared from Safari on iPhone, or something you scheduled earlier — WakeMinder bridges the gap between mobile input and desktop awareness.

It’s built for people who are often on the move, get distracted, or just need that little push at just the right moment. You can schedule reminders for when the Mac wakes, or choose intervals (one, two, three hours), or set “Tomorrow”, "In X days", or a custom date & time. Thanks to iCloud sync, everything you enter on your Apple devices is there the moment your Mac reactivates. For those who want minimal friction, there's voice input, sharing of links or notes from other apps, and a clean, no-clutter interface that respects your focus.

WakeMinder supports offline use fairly well — reminders already synced or entered while online will still display on Mac wake even if you’re temporarily offline. It’s lightweight, visually calm, and designed not to bombard you, but to serve you just in time.

## ℹ️ About

WakeMinder was created because of a simple observation: many small tasks or reminders happen right *before* we step away from our Mac or when we remember something while doing something else — but by the time we return to the Mac, we’ve forgotten. Traditional reminders often fail to catch us in that moment. WakeMinder fills in that gap. It’s a purpose-built app for those moments when you need a gentle nudge right when your Mac wakes.

The developer built WakeMinder with tight Apple ecosystem integration in mind. It uses iCloud to sync reminders, supports input from Apple Watch or iPhone (with voice dictation or share sheet), and is optimized for macOS wake events. That way, whether you added something on the go or in your head, it’s waiting for you when your Mac returns to life. 

Performance is important: WakeMinder is designed to consume minimal system resources, not slow down wake cycles, and not create clutter. The interface is simple — no unnecessary panels, no distracting extras. For people who want reminders without complexity, it's perfect.

Privacy is a priority. It doesn’t collect extra data, doesn’t require lots of permissions, and your reminders live in your Apple-owned services (iCloud). You control what you enter, what is synced, and how often.

WakeMinder is ideal for professionals, creatives, students, or anyone who wants to stay on top of their tasks in a proactive way — especially if you get distracted, forget things, or switch devices often.
